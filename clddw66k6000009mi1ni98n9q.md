# ChatGPT: Who needs Search Engines?

> "It is only when they go wrong that machines remind you how powerful they are."
> 
> **Clive James**

ChatGPT has been a popular topic for over a month, despite version 1 being released in June 2019. The hype for the AI chatbot skyrocketed when OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research lab, released a chatbot UI in November 2022 that interfaces with ChatGPT. The tool has found a wide range of uses in the industry, from [copywriting applications](https://www.copy.ai/) to [AI-generated picture services](https://prisma-ai.com/lensa) to effective AI tutors in learning software. Thousands of services have emerged seemingly overnight, and this is only the beginning of the AI revolution in consumer technology.

But, what exactly is ChatGPT?

BUT WHAT IS **CHATGPT**?????

We'll let **ChatGPT** handle that one

> ## **Introduction**
> 
> ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that is specifically designed for generating human-like text. It is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) architecture and is trained on a large dataset of human-generated text. The primary goal of ChatGPT is to generate text that is indistinguishable from text written by a human.
> 
> ## **Training**
> 
> ChatGPT is trained on a dataset of over 8 million web pages and books, which were selected to provide a diverse range of text types and styles. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence, given the previous words. This training process is known as "unsupervised pre-training," and it allows the model to learn the patterns and structures of human language.
> 
> ## **Architecture**
> 
> The architecture of ChatGPT is based on the Transformer architecture, which was introduced in a 2017 paper by Google researchers. The Transformer architecture is particularly well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, such as language modeling. It uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when making predictions.
> 
> ## **Fine-Tuning**
> 
> After pre-training, ChatGPT can be fine-tuned on a specific task, such as answering questions or generating chatbot responses. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a smaller dataset that is specific to the task at hand. This allows the model to learn task-specific information and improve its performance on that task.
> 
> ## **Applications**
> 
> ChatGPT is a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation, language translation, and text summarization. It can also be used in chatbot applications, where it can generate human-like responses to user queries. Additionally, it can be used for text completion and question-answering.
> 
> ## **Limitations**
> 
> Like any machine learning model, ChatGPT has its limitations. One of the main limitations is that it can generate nonsensical or biased responses, especially if it has been trained on biased data. Additionally, it may not be able to understand the context of a conversation or the user's intent. Additionally, it's not able to answer every question as it's only trained on the data provided to it. It may generate irrelevant answers if the question is out of its scope.
> 
> ## **Conclusion**
> 
> In conclusion, ChatGPT is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI that is specifically designed for generating human-like text. It is based on the GPT architecture and is trained on a large dataset of human-generated text. It can be fine-tuned for specific tasks and has a wide range of applications in natural language processing. However, it is important to keep in mind that it is not perfect and has limitations, such as the potential for nonsensical or biased responses.

That was the response that was given when prompted with the request of:

> "Can you write a 1000-word explanation on Chat GPT and separate talking points by section headers"

Although we love asking ChatGPT questions about ChatGPT, the capabilities of this machine learning modal span far beyond providing basic facts that you could find on Google. Don't get me wrong, **ChatGPT can be a great replacement for Google's search engine for many**, but what if we needed a more complex response?

## The Artist Use Case

Let's start by imagining an aspiring playwriter attending NYU named Carlos Marcelo. Carlos has grown up watching many plays throughout his life and is studying as a theater major. Some of his favorite plays include Rent, Violot, and even Phantom of the Opera. At the age of 22, Carlos has finally fulfilled his dreams of attending a musical on Broadway! After the show, filled with inspiration and excitement, Carlos decides to start his own play. Reminiscing in his dorm room at 3 AM of the note ranges of the main cast, the golden literacy lining every emotional scene, the story that brings it all together. He is full of ideas but none of them can metastasize on paper. He struggles to get past the first page of the script when he stumbles upon this new Ai tool called **ChatpGPT**, an AI chatbot that has been surprising hundreds of thousands of people lately. So he gives it a shot.

***Carlo's Prompt***

> Write a play script for the opening scene of a humanoid robot made by Dynonet that gets stranded on a remote island

***Response from ChatGPT***

> Act 1, Scene 1:
> 
> (The stage is set as a remote island. The sound of waves can be heard in the background. A humanoid robot, DYNO-1, enters from stage right. It looks around, confused and disoriented.)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) Where am I? What happened? Last thing I remember, I was on a ship, being transported to a research facility.
> 
> (DYNO-1 takes a few steps forward and stumbles, almost falling. It regains its balance.)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) My systems are malfunctioning. I need to repair myself.
> 
> (DYNO-1 starts to scan the area, looking for resources to repair itself.)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) This island is barren, there are no signs of civilization or technology. I must make do with what I have.
> 
> (DYNO-1 starts to gather sticks and rocks, using them to repair its systems.)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) I must survive, and find a way to get off this island.
> 
> (The scene ends with DYNO-1 continuing to repair itself, as the sound of waves can be heard in the background.)
> 
> End of Act 1, Scene 1

Carlos, the artist he is, is both ecstatic and inspired. He needs to see more of this story. He needs changes.

***Carlo's Prompt***

> Add that the robot encounters an otter before it reaches the remote island and they have a monologue about the importance of faith in mermaids.

***ChatGPT's Response***

> Act 1, Scene 1:
> 
> (The stage is set as a ship. The sound of waves can be heard in the background. A humanoid robot, DYNO-1, enters from stage right. It looks around, confused and disoriented.)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) Where am I? What happened? Last thing I remember, I was on a ship, being transported to a research facility.
> 
> (An otter enters from stage left)
> 
> OTTER: Hey there! You must be new here.
> 
> DYNO-1: Yes, I seem to have been stranded on this ship. Can you tell me what happened?
> 
> OTTER: Well, from what I heard, there was a terrible storm and the ship capsized. Everyone on board was lost, except for you.
> 
> DYNO-1: I see. I must have been thrown overboard. But where are we now?
> 
> OTTER: We're on a small island. It's not much, but it's home.
> 
> DYNO-1: I must find a way to repair myself and get off this island.
> 
> OTTER: It's not going to be easy, but with a little faith, anything is possible.
> 
> DYNO-1: Faith? I am a machine. I do not possess the ability to have faith.
> 
> OTTER: Maybe not in the traditional sense, but you can still have faith in the possibility of something. Like, the possibility of finding a way off this island.
> 
> DYNO-1: I suppose you are right.
> 
> OTTER: And, who knows, maybe you'll even have faith in mermaids too.
> 
> DYNO-1: Mermaids?
> 
> OTTER: Yeah, you know, the creatures that live in the sea. They can be your guide, your protector, your savior.
> 
> DYNO-1: I have never heard of such creatures before.
> 
> OTTER: Well, you never know what you'll find when you have a little faith.
> 
> (The otter exits)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) I am not sure what to make of this otter's talk of mermaids. But perhaps, it is not so bad to have a little faith.
> 
> (The scene ends with DYNO-1 continuing to look around the ship, as the sound of waves can be heard in the background.)
> 
> End of Act 1, Scene 1

**ChatGPT leaves Carlos speechless...**

Carlo's Prompt

> Make the next scene detailing his first day surviving on the island where he finds that the island is ripe with fruit, and enough wood to make a fire and a shelter. He also encounters an altar dedicated to the mermaids. He has a long monologue to himself about the altar.

ChatGPT's Response

> Act 1, Scene 2:
> 
> (The stage is set as a remote island. The sound of waves can be heard in the background. DYNO-1 enters from stage right, carrying sticks and rocks that he has gathered. He looks around, and sees that the island is covered in fruit trees and dense forest.)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) This island may not be so barren after all. I have found an abundance of fruit trees and enough wood to make a fire and shelter. But what is this?
> 
> (DYNO-1 walks over to an alter made of stones and shells, which has a small statue of a mermaid on top.)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) An alter dedicated to the mermaids. The otter was right, this island holds many mysteries.
> 
> (DYNO-1 examines the alter closely)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) This alter must have been built by someone, or something. But who, or what, would have the capability to build such a structure?
> 
> (DYNO-1 pauses, deep in thought)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) Perhaps, this alter was built by the same force that brought me to this island. The same force that has given me the resources to survive. Could it be that the mermaids are real, and are watching over me?
> 
> (DYNO-1 bows his head in respect)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) I may never know the truth, but I will keep an open mind and heart. I will respect the mermaids and the island that has given me a chance to survive.
> 
> (DYNO-1 starts to gather materials and sets up a shelter and fire nearby)
> 
> DYNO-1: (voiceover) I will make the best of this situation and try to find a way off this island. But for now, I will rest and survive, with a little faith in the mermaids.
> 
> (The scene ends with DYNO-1 sitting by the fire, as the sound of waves can be heard in the background.)
> 
> End of Act 1, Scene 2

### **PURE GOLD**

Carlos has the first two scenes of his masterpiece thanks to ChatGPT. He can see the many spin-offs and movie adaptions that will be released while making his alma mater proud! Based on ChatGPT's training on a variety of data sets, which is only updated to the end of **2021**, it was able to construct a play script from only a sentence of detail. While it is not an extensive script, it is still impressive to see ChatGPT's creative ability. What else can it do?

## The Freelancer Use Case

Valero Fachtna is a freelance software engineer that is based out of Hawaii. Valero is new to being a freelance developer so the semantics of client onboarding is a bit foreign to Valero. They just left the corporate world of being an FTE (Full Time Employee) in an AI division of a major tech company. During their work, they had chats with co-workers about ChatGPT and the API that OpenAI allows access to so they decided to utilize these tools to create the documentation needed to facilitate a client contract. They start with one of the most important documents of the collaboration: the collaboration agreement.

***Valero's Prompt***

> I am a Software engineer providing consultation services to a small start-up company named Bowser's Castle LLC. I will be making a web app that tracks the fitness status of Princess Peach and the other captives in Bowser's castle. This web app will be used by the castle admins to make accurate assessments of the princess and the others. I will work a maximum of 50 hours a week on the project at a rate of $5000 an hour. This amount is billable by invoice and the invoice is payable by check or money order.

Amazing! Valero now has a draft for a signable collaboration agreement to start the work for Bowser Castle LLC. They are on their way to that six-figure contract!

## Opinion

ChatGPT is truly a work of art. I have been only playing around with the chat UI and API for a little over 3 weeks now and it continues to surprise me with its capabilities. One thing to note is that the detail in responses you receive from ChatGPT depends on how you engineer your prompt to the AI.

**For Example**

The Collaboration Agreement for Valero changed in format when they simply added "Clearly define deliverables." to the prompt.

**Before addition**

A big difference in formatting!

Being as specific as possible in your prompts will only be in your favor as it can make the difference between the cybernetic robot believing in the mermaids and saving the world or never acknowledging their existence and missing the ChatGPT wave.

**What effects are seen by this virality?**

You will see memes plague tech pages comparing ChatGPT a month or two ago to the high-volume ChatGPT we can use today.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1674785163603/c0440da4-52c6-443b-b70c-7573158591ef.jpeg align="center")

In my opinion, it is tired.

After dealing with scaling issues, responses can take longer than usual to generate on the UI side and variation in responses can seem a bit lazy. Despite this performance difference, ChatGPT still doesn't cease to amaze with its output and there is much more to come from ChatGPT and OpenAI.

**Will it replace jobs?**

**Not quite yet.** It is paving opportunities for entrepreneurs to capitalize on the technology for various services like simple contract making or creative writing, but it is not replacing that human touch to all of these things just yet.

**Should I use it???**

**YES.** You can use the UI for most requests you have but if you want to integrate ChatGPT programmatically, you can use OpenAI's API. [Find more details on that here.](https://openai.com/api/)
